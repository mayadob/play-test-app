My first Play Framework test application that:

1. parses an input url
2. reads from the flixster_user table in the snapshot databases
3. return JSON response

Files that I created / updated:

app/controllers/Application.java 
app/models/flixster_user.java
conf/META-INF/persistence.xml - added hibernate config for database
conf/application.conf - added jpa.default definition
conf/routes
project/Build.scala - added javaJpa, mysql, org.hibernate dependencies
